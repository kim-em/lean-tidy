/- Improvements:

* Store the local_context, and its types, rather than recomputing.
* Give up earlier if our current expression is obviously still just a hypothesis.
* Don't use dsimplify; does it still work?
  * If not, try using whnf
* In mk_apps, `to_expr` is probably too expensive. Can we get away with just the second option?
* In the second option, `mk_app_aux`, either delete the instance implicit branch, and hope unify
  handles typeclass inference for us later, or make do typeclass inference by hand, using `apply_instance`

For testing, we better be able to run against lean-category-theory...
